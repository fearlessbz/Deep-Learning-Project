# Deep-Learning-Project

We join the Kaggle computation launched by Lyft to build a motion prediction model for self-driving cars. The link of the Kaggle competition is as following:

The ipython file cannot run in the local environment, you should create a notebook on Kaggle and run it under the Kaggle environment.
